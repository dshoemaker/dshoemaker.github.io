title: Adding My Own Introduction
---


It looks like you've stumbled upon the beginning of my github.io page. Sorry there isn't much here at the moment. I'm working on getting some work added to my portfolio. Once I've taken care of that, I'll get started on putting words to web in this nifty little blog. Feel free to explore some of my older work on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/dshoemaker) or you can swing by and check out the beginning of a [Twitter Clone](https://bitbucket.org/dshoemaker) that I've built in React and Ruby on Rails.

There are still some changes to be made here on this site. There are leftovers from the awesome Hyde theme that I decided to make use of. Changes coming soon. Thanks for stopping by!
